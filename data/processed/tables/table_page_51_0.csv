"Assessment. Staff assesses the 2023 external position to be moderately stronger than the level implied by
fundamentals and desirable policies, based on the External Balance Assessment (EBA-Lite) regression model
that yields a positive CA gap of 2.0 percent of GDP (text table). The REER regression model, which suggests
a negative CA gap (–4.7 percent of GDP), was deemed less suitable for Qatar given its currency peg. Qatar’s
significant reliance on hydrocarbons complicates the application of standard external assessment
methodologies, given the large hydrocarbon price volatility in 2020–22 and more recent export volume
volatility. Some of the volatility is captured by the adjustments for cyclical contributions and conflicts
(0.9 percent and -1.1 percent of GDP, respectively). As the current account surplus is projected to moderate
further in 2024, the CA gap is expected to narrow, aligning the external position more with the level implied
by fundamentals and desirable policies.

,Capital and Financial Accounts: Flows and Policy Measures,
"Background. The capital and financial account weakened in 2023. The composition shifted notably. Net
portfolio outflows rose by nearly 10 percentage points of GDP to 15 percent of GDP, driven by portfolio
investments abroad (11 percent of GDP). In contrast, net other investment outflows declined by
16 percentage points to 1 percent of GDP. Overseas investment declined and net reduction in liabilities
mostly by commercial banks following the introduction of QCB measures, moderated. In 2024Q2, net
portfolio outflows abated while net incurrence of other investment liabilities resumed.",,
