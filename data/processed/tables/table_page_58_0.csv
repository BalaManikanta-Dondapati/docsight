"Commentary: Qatar is at a low overall risk of sovereign stress. Hydrocarbon prices are set to remain relatively high and commitmen
to, and the recent track record of, fiscal discipline support low fiscal and debt risk. The large reserves of natural gas, cleaner than
other browner fossil fuels, is likely to play a key role in a smoother energy transition, and strong financial buffers (including from the
sovereign wealth fund, QIA) can provide support if downside risks materialize. The projected non-hydrocarbon primary balance
(NHPB) is broadly consistent with the benchmark guided by the Permanent Income Hypothesis (PIH) in the long term (see the main
text of the Staff Report). The authorities are in the process of producing own actuarial studies on the sustainability of the pension
system.",Commentary: Qatar is at a low overall risk of sovereign stress. Hydrocarbon prices are set to remain relatively high and commitmen,,,,,,,,,,,,,
